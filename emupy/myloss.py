class MyLoss(_Loss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that measures the mean squared error (squared L2 norm) between
    each element in the input :math:`x` and target :math:`y`.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = \left( x_n - y_n \right)^2,

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) =
        \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`mean';}\\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  &  \text{if reduction} = \text{`sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    :math:`x` and :math:`y` are tensors of arbitrary shapes with a total
    of :math:`n` elements each.

    The mean operation still operates over all the elements, and divides by :math:`n`.

    The division by :math:`n` can be avoided if one sets ``reduction = 'sum'``.

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when :attr:`reduce` is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where :math:`*` means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input

    Examples::

        >>> loss = nn.MSELoss()
        >>> input = torch.randn(3, 5, requires_grad=True)
        >>> target = torch.randn(3, 5)
        >>> output = loss(input, target)
        >>> output.backward()
